# PassManagerApp

This repo to explore NodeJs. I learn basic module like http and fs module. With those modules, I try to build simple static web server. This simple password manager app use library sjcl for the encrypt process.
The encryption and decryption process happen in client as that is the best way to secure the master password.
The server-side is only store the list of passwords.
